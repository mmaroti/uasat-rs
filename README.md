# UASATRS

A SAT solver based calculator for discrete mathematics and universal algebra.

## GOALS:
* Formulas: first order sentences on multiple domains (tensors, no power set)
* Small structures: elements are integers, operations and relations are tensors
* Large structures: elements are tensors, operations and relations are formulas
* Turn large structures into small ones using SAT solver
* Subalgebra/congruence lattice of small algebras is a large meet semilattice
* Find meet irreducible elements of large meet semilattice, get large lattice
* Turn large Galois connection (clones) into a small Galois connection
* Varieties: signature, axioms, theorems, ability to verify on structures
* Polymorphic large structures (parameterized by integers, maybe by tensors)
